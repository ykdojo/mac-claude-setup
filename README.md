# Setting up a dedicated Mac for Claude Code (full access, isolated)

How to turn a spare Mac into a remote, full-access machine for running Claude Code,
controlled over SSH from your main Mac - with secure clipboard sync between the two.

## Why this setup

Running an agent with broad permissions is safer on a machine that has nothing to lose.
The approach here:

- **Use an old/spare Mac**, not your main one.
- **Create a fresh local account with no personal data and no Apple ID** signed in, so
  the agent has nothing sensitive to reach.
- **Drive it over SSH** from your main Mac on the local network.
- **Move text between the two with a clipboard-over-SSH shortcut.**

The result is an isolated sandbox you can give full access to, while still typing from
your main machine.

## What you need

- A spare Mac (the **target**).
- Your everyday Mac (the **source**), on the same Wi-Fi.
- Both able to see each other on the local network.

Terminology used below: **target** = the spare Mac running Claude Code, **source** =
your main Mac you type on.

---

## 1. Create a fresh, isolated account on the target Mac

- Create a **new local user account** (System Settings -> Users & Groups).
- **Do not sign into an Apple ID.** Skip it during setup.
- Keep it empty: no personal files, no synced accounts.

### Make the account an admin

The account needs admin rights or `sudo` will refuse to run (`<user> is not in the
sudoers file. This incident has been reported to the administrator.`).

- System Settings -> Users & Groups -> set the account to **Allow this user to
  administer this computer**.
- If you ever need to repair it from another admin account:
  `sudo dseditgroup -o edit -a <user> -t user admin`

---

## 2. Enable Remote Login (SSH) on the target Mac

**Method used here (verified):** `sudo systemsetup -setremotelogin on`

This fails with `Turning Remote Login on or off requires Full Disk Access privileges`
unless your terminal app has Full Disk Access. To grant it:

- System Settings -> Privacy & Security -> **Full Disk Access** (scroll the privacy
  list to find it).
- Click **+**, then in the file picker go to **Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal**
  and add it.
- Quit and reopen the terminal, then rerun the command.

---

## 3. Find the target's address (hostname or IP)

You can reach the target by either a hostname or an IP. Use the **hostname**: it stays
the same, while the IP can change.

**Hostname (recommended).** Run on the target:

```bash
scutil --get LocalHostName      # prints the hostname, e.g. MacBook-Pro
```

Add `.local` to form the address: `<target-host>.local`. You can also read it from
System Settings -> General -> Sharing, shown as `Local hostname`.

**IP address.** Run on the target:

```bash
ipconfig getifaddr en0          # e.g. 192.168.1.80
```

The IP comes from DHCP and can change after a reboot or when the lease expires. If you
want a fixed IP, add a DHCP reservation in your router.

> Throughout the rest of this guide, replace `<user>` with the target account name and
> `<target-host>` with the hostname from above (so the address is
> `<user>@<target-host>.local`). You can use an IP in place of `<target-host>.local`.

---

## 4. Set up passwordless SSH from the source Mac

On the **source** Mac:

```bash
# Create a key only if you don't already have one
ssh-keygen -t ed25519

# Install your public key on the target (asks for the target account's
# LOGIN password once - not your Apple ID, not the source Mac's password)
ssh-copy-id <user>@<target-host>.local
```

Test it:

```bash
ssh <user>@<target-host>.local whoami   # should print the target username, no password
```

To get an interactive shell on the target:

```bash
ssh <user>@<target-host>.local
```

---

## 5. Clipboard sync over SSH

macOS ships `pbcopy` (write clipboard) and `pbpaste` (read clipboard). Piped over SSH,
they move the clipboard between machines - encrypted, peer-to-peer, no account, no
third-party service.

Add to `~/.zshrc` on the **source** Mac:

```bash
# --- Target Mac clipboard over SSH ---
NEWMAC="<user>@<target-host>.local"
alias sendclip='pbpaste | ssh "$NEWMAC" pbcopy'   # source -> target
alias getclip='ssh "$NEWMAC" pbpaste | pbcopy'    # target -> source
```

Then `source ~/.zshrc`.

Usage - the commands take **no arguments**; they act on your system clipboard:

- **sendclip**: copy on the source (Cmd-C), run `sendclip`, paste on the target (Cmd-V).
- **getclip**: copy on the target (Cmd-C), run `getclip`, paste on the source (Cmd-V).

Handles multi-line text, code, URLs - anything plain text.

## 6. Install Claude Code on the target Mac

Send the install command over and run it. From the source Mac you can push it straight
to the target's clipboard, or run it remotely:

```bash
ssh <user>@<target-host>.local 'curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash'
```

The native installer may warn that `~/.local/bin` is not on PATH. Fix it on the target:

```bash
ssh <user>@<target-host>.local 'echo '\''export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"'\'' >> ~/.zshrc'
```

Then **open a fresh terminal session on the target** (or SSH in interactively) and run
`claude` to log in - the login flow is interactive, so it needs a real terminal, not a
one-shot SSH command.

```bash
ssh <user>@<target-host>.local      # then run: claude
```

---

## Remote access (different networks)

Everything above works only on the **same local network**. To reach the target from
anywhere without exposing it to the internet, add [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) on
both Macs - it gives each a stable private IP that works from any network, still
end-to-end encrypted, no router port-forwarding.

## Quick reference

| Action | Command (run on source Mac) |
| --- | --- |
| Shell on target | `ssh <user>@<target-host>.local` |
| Run Claude Code on target | `ssh -t <user>@<target-host>.local 'claude'` |
| Send clipboard to target | `sendclip` |
| Pull clipboard from target | `getclip` |
| Target's Wi-Fi IP (run on target) | `ipconfig getifaddr en0` |
